## Project Overview

A React application to search tracks, discover artists and album details, and listen to its audio preview using Spotify's Web API. This project aims to provide easy access to create a playlist and save it to the user's Spotify account.

## Features

- **Spotify Library:** Requests to Spotify API to display content from the Spotify library. Search for tracks to include in the user's custom playlist.

- **Playlist Creation:** Create playlists by selecting tracks from the Spotify library.
